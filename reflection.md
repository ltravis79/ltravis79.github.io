**What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?**
I've learned that you really need to be aware of the default margins and padding that come with elements, and that they can start to move your other items around unintentionally.

**What did you learn about CSS positioning?**
I learned that it's not easy to position things with CSS.  There are so many factors at work you may need to change properties on multiple items to get one positioned where you want it.

**What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?**
I think it was easiest to implement the aesthetics like fonts and colors.  It was most difficult to deal with positioning for me, I'm still struggling to get things in the right place.

**What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?**
You definitely need to be aware of where you add elements in your HTML because they may inherit properties from other elements with CSS.  I also learned to be careful with how selectors are labeled in CSS across multiple HTML files.  It helps to use specific classes and ids to prevent the wrong items from formatting.
