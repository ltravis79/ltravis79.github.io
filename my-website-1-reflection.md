Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
	After signing in to GitHub, click the plus sign on the right side of your profile, and then choose new repository.  
	On the new repository screen give your repository a name, description, and license info.
	After you click create, to clone it, you can copy the repository link from the right side of the repository screen, then from your computer termina, type git clone and enter the link you copy.

Describe what open source means.
	Open source is the idea of sharing not only your program, but the source code of the program, meaning that other users can see how your program actually works, and they may be able to add to it or make changes as they want to.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
	It definitely feels a little utopian to me, allowing everyone to work on it for the greater good.  But it also makes me really nervous, I wonder pessimissistically if that means people will just take code and use it and not give proper credit.

Assess the importance of using licenses.
	Licenses are important because they define the specific restrictions that you want to put in place if you are going to allow other people to use your code.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
	Creating a feature branch was solidified for me, because I actually forgot to do it.  I did my work in the master branch, and then realized the mistake when I didn't have a branch in order to do a pull request.  My changes surprised me and were already there after I pushed the repo up to GitHub.  I definitely need to work more on the branching part of the workflow in order to remember it.

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.


My thoughts...
It was good to learn about the differences between some of the different licenses, and why they are used.  I would like to learn a little more about how they actually handle protecting you.  It seems to me that even though a license is stated for the use, if the code is still open source, what stops a person from using it wrongly if they want to?

Missing the step to create a feature branch definitely caught my attention (eventually).  I'm going to have to work on that to avoid making changes in my master branches.
