Reflection Questions...

How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
    It was pretty smoth wireframing and creating HTML with a pair.  We had a pretty good starting point for the wireframe, which allowed us to discuss a few changes, but really move forward.
Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
    A little bit.  I think that the blog posts seem pretty simple (for now) so the wireframing seems to be pretty similar to what I already had in my head.
What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
    We wanted to make sure that we had sections for both the header and the content, making sure to cover everything.
What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
    My pair introduced me to a new element called select that displays a drop down list of choices.
