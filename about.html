      <p>Who is Lindsey?  I grew up and still live in the Phoenix area.  After high school, I held a few odd jobs before getting hired by a local
      healthcare company.  Since then, I've spent about 15 years learning the business office aspect of our hospitals and the healthcare industry, 
      working my way up our department.  I developed a good sense for improving and automating processes throughout the business office, and I enjoy 
      looking at problems and finding solutions to improve our operation.  In the time after high school I've also earned an Associate's Degree in Computer Information Systems.

      <p>When I'm not at work, one of my favorite hobbies is playing ice hockey.  Most people think it's odd living in a desert, but I think it makes 
      even more sense that way.  When it's 115 degrees outside that ice rink is nice and cool.  Everyone else is missing out!
      </p>
      <p>In the past few years I've also started learning photography, particularly using a DSLR camera as opposed to a little point and shoot camera.  A nice thing about Arizona, despite its reputation as a desert, you don't actually have to go far to get all sorts of different scenery- we have deserts, forests, mountains, snow, all of which makes for great photos.  And it's not hard to head over to California if I want to try some ocean photographs.
