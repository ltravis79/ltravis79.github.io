                <p>Building this personal website has been interesting, but a challenge for me to say the least!
                </p>

                <p>Coming up with content can be difficult for me.  The writing on the blog posts has come pretty easily, but the information on the other, non-blog pages, about myself is a challenge.  It's not that I don't know the information, but I think I struggle with talking about myself, and I can't decide what to put on there without seeming either forced or dry and boring.
                </p>

                <p>But coming up with content was only the beginning.  Once visual layout and formatting got thrown into the mix, everything turned frustrating in a hurry.  I've never considered myself very artistic, and I think that limits me to a much more basic design for the web page.  And even with a basic design, formatting has been a chore.  I think I've got a good handle on CSS syntax and how it works, but I really have trouble getting the nuances to work of positioning individual elements and getting things to flow together.  There's been lots of trial and error.
                </p>

                <p>Even struggling with the layout, I've definitely picked up some new skills for websites.  In particular, the last time I did any HTML work prior to this the new symantic HTML5 tags weren't in the picture yet, so those are all new to me.
