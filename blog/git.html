          In programming and development, there's a vitally important concept called version control.  There are a lot of tools out there to help with it, but I'm going to discuss two of them - git and GitHub.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why version control to begin with?  The simple answer could just be for your own sanity.  Version control means keeping track of the changes you've made to your program or documents, and more importantly being able to go back to a previous version if you need to.  For instance, you could be working on changes to your program, but maybe the new concept you were trying out isn't really going to work, or turns out to not be the direction you want to go.  Well if you've been using version control, it's really easy to back up from where you are to what the old version was.  Without it, you might have to scramble to find the right files, or worse yet, redo the entire old version!

        <p>
          So how do you go about version control?  A popular tool is a program called git.  Git keeps track of the files in your project, or repository, and keeps track of which ones you've changed and which ones you've left alone.  Git also lets you work with a copy of your files while your current version of a program or website is still up and active, this way you don't cause a downtime while you make changes.  You can ask git for a status of your work, and it can then tell you which files you've changed and which ones are new, which you'll probably want to add.  Every time you make some changes, you can make a commit in git, and it treats that as your save point, and keeps track of the version of files at that point.  The more you commit, the more available points in time you have to go back to if the need arises.

          What's GitHub if that was git?  GitHub is a website that can host your repositories, and also provides a community of people that may be willing and able to help you work on your code, especially if you're stuck getting somehting to work.  By storing your files on GitHub, you'll also have them available to you if you needed to work from a different computer, or without having to carry around portable drives, which is a plus.  You can use the git software to move files back and forth from GitHub and the local computer you are using.  Once you're done with changes, put the files back on GitHub, and they'll be there if you need them from a new computer.  Because the files are stored on the internet, you can also allow other GitHub users to work with them.  Your main repository stays intact, but they can help collaborate on a project.  If everything works, you can then merge their changes into the project.
